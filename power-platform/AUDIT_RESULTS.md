# Power Platform - Implementation Audit Results

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** Partial Implementation - Critical Issues Found

---

## Executive Summary

The Power Platform has **significant structure** in place, but has **NEVER BEEN TESTED END-TO-END**. The main blocker has been **Docker Desktop instability on Mac** preventing database connectivity.

**Critical Finding:** We need to **switch to SQLite immediately** to enable local testing without Docker dependency.

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Nothing Has Been Tested

**Primary Blocker:** Docker Desktop on Mac is unstable
- Docker daemon crashes/stops repeatedly
- PostgreSQL container starts then dies
- API starts but can't connect to DB
- Every test attempt hits "Connection refused"

**Compounding Factors:**
1. Focused on deployment instead of features
2. Never switched to simpler local dev setup
3. No SQLite fallback for testing
4. No seed data to test with
5. No end-to-end test plan

---

## RECOMMENDED FIX STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Enable Local Testing (CRITICAL - Do First)

**Switch to SQLite for Development**
```python
# config.py
database_url: str = "sqlite:///./power_platform.db"  # Simple file-based DB
```

**Benefits:**
- No Docker required
- Always available
- Fast startup
- Easy to inspect
- No connection issues

**Implementation:**
1. Update `config.py` with SQLite default
2. Test migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
3. Verify API starts and connects
4. Run one API endpoint test

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Create Seed Data & Demo (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal:** One-click working demo

**Tasks:**
1. Create `backend/app/seed.py` script
2. Seed demo user, org, project
3. Create sample DAB simulation
4. Pre-generate plots (efficiency, waveforms, THD)
5. Pre-generate sample PDF report
6. Add "Load Demo" button to frontend

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User clicks "Load Demo"
- Dashboard shows sample project with run
- Clicking run shows plots and metrics
- Can download PDF report

**Time Estimate:** 2 hours

---

### Phase 3: Test Core Simulation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Verify DAB simulation works

**Tasks:**
1. Write pytest for DAB single-phase
2. Test with known good parameters
3. Verify efficiency calculation
4. Verify waveform generation
5. Verify THD calculation
6. Compare to hand calculations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- DAB simulation completes
- Efficiency is reasonable (>90%)
- THD is reasonable (<5%)
- Results match theory

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### Phase 4: Test ZVS Analysis (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Verify ZVS logic works

**Tasks:**
1. Test ZVS feasibility for known good/bad cases
2. Generate ZVS map
3. Verify boundaries make sense
4. Test optimizer

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour

---

### Phase 5: Test Device Library (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Verify CSV loading works

**Tasks:**
1. Test CSV parser with default_devices.csv
2. Verify devices load correctly
3. Test interpolation logic
4. Test temperature scaling

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour

---

### Phase 6: Test Compliance Engine (LOWER PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Verify rules evaluation works

**Tasks:**
1. Test YAML parser
2. Run compliance check on sample results
3. Verify pass/fail logic
4. Test PDF generation (may need WeasyPrint fix)

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### Phase 7: Complete Documentation (ONGOING)

**Tasks:**
1. Update README with SQLite instructions
2. Write USER_GUIDE.md with screenshots
3. Write METHODS.md with equations
4. Document each feature as tested

**Time Estimate:** Ongoing

✅ Call simulation API endpoint
✅ Verify it completes
✅ Check results make sense
✅ View in frontend

### Step 4: Document What Works (15 min)
✅ Update AUDIT_RESULTS.md with findings
✅ Update README with working instructions
✅ Commit progress

**Total Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours
**Tokens Needed:** ~40-50k for implementation + testing

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Minimum Viable Demo (End of This Session):**
1. ✅ API starts with SQLite (no Docker)
2. ✅ Database has demo data
3. ✅ Can call `/api/sim/topologies/simulate` successfully
4. ✅ Simulation returns reasonable results
5. ✅ Frontend can display results

**Stretch Goals (If Time Permits):**
- ✅ ZVS map generation works
- ✅ Device CSV loading works
- ✅ One compliance check works
- ✅ Full tests passing

---

## CONCLUSION

**The platform has GOOD STRUCTURE but NO VALIDATION.**

**The fix is simple:**
1. Switch to SQLite (remove Docker dependency)
2. Create seed data
3. Test systematically
4. Document what works

**This can be done in ONE focused session.**

Let's start with SQLite migration NOW.

---

**Next Action:** Update `config.py` to use SQLite by default.
