# Power Platform Implementation Checklist

**Status:** INCOMPLETE - Needs full implementation verification and SQLite migration

## Session Summary

### What Was Attempted
- Multiple attempts to get localhost working with Docker + PostgreSQL
- Docker Desktop on Mac proved unstable (kept stopping/crashing)
- Added demo mode for anonymous access (committed but untested)
- Fixed CORS configuration
- Fixed WeasyPrint optional import
- Frontend parameter mapping fixes (pout, phi_deg)

### Critical Issues
1. **Docker instability on Mac** - PostgreSQL container never stayed running
2. **Database connection failures** - API couldn't consistently connect to DB
3. **No end-to-end testing** - System never fully tested
4. **Unknown feature completeness** - Many master prompt features never verified

## Implementation Strategy for Next Session

### Step 1: SQLite Migration (30 min)
1. Update `config.py`: `database_url: str = "sqlite:///./power_platform.db"`
2. Test migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
3. Update `START_LOCALHOST.sh` to NOT require Docker
4. Verify API starts and connects to SQLite

### Step 2: Feature Audit (60 min)
Go through EVERY checkbox above systematically:
1. Check if code exists
2. Test if it works
3. Mark ✅ if working, ❌ if broken/missing
4. Document what needs to be built

### Step 3: Build Missing Features (Remaining Time)
Priority order:
1. **Core simulation** - DAB must work end-to-end
2. **ZVS analysis** - At least basic feasibility check
3. **Device library** - CSV loading and selection
4. **Demo mode** - One-click working demo
5. **Compliance** - Basic IEEE-1547 checks
6. **HIL** - At least mock adapter working

### Step 4: End-to-End Test (30 min)
1. Start API with SQLite
2. Start frontend
3. Click through entire flow:
   - Load demo
   - Create project
   - Run simulation
   - View results (efficiency, waveforms, THD)
   - Check ZVS map
   - Run compliance check
   - Generate PDF report
4. Document any issues

### Step 5: Commit & Document (15 min)
1. Commit all changes
2. Update README with working instructions
3. Create video/screenshot demo if time permits

## Current Code State

### What EXISTS (may or may not work):
- Backend FastAPI app structure
- Frontend React + Vite structure
- Database models (User, Org, Project, Run, etc.)
- Some API routes (auth, topologies, runs, compliance, hil, zvs)
- Some frontend pages (Dashboard, NewRun, Compliance, HIL)
- Docker Compose setup (but unstable on Mac)
- Demo mode authentication (added this session, untested)

### What's UNCERTAIN:
- Do simulations actually run and return results?
- Does ZVS analysis produce meaningful output?
- Do device CSV files load and get used?
- Does HIL mock adapter work?
- Do compliance rules evaluate correctly?
- Can users actually see plots/waveforms?
- Does PDF generation work (WeasyPrint issues)?

### Known BROKEN:
- Docker Desktop on Mac (crashes repeatedly)
- PostgreSQL connection (database never stayed running)
- Frontend → API communication (ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE)
- End-to-end workflow (never successfully tested)

---

## Success Criteria for Next Session

### Minimum Viable Demo:
1. ✅ User can start app with ONE command (no Docker)
2. ✅ User can click "Try Demo" button
3. ✅ User can select "Single-Phase DAB" topology
4. ✅ User can enter parameters and click "Run Simulation"
5. ✅ User sees progress indicator
6. ✅ User sees efficiency plot and key metrics
7. ✅ User can click "ZVS Analysis" and see feasibility
8. ✅ User can download results as JSON/CSV

### Stretch Goals:
- Working compliance check with PDF report
- Working device library with CSV upload
- Working mock HIL with live telemetry plot
- Full test suite passing

---

## Notes for Next Session

### Development Environment:
- **Database:** SQLite (file: `./power_platform.db`)
- **No Docker required** for development
- **Start command:** `./START_LOCALHOST_SQLITE.sh` (to be created)
- **API:** http://localhost:8080
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3001
- **Demo mode:** Enabled by default

### Key Files to Review:
1. `backend/app/services/sim/topologies/dab_single.py` - Core DAB simulation
2. `backend/app/services/sim/zvs/zvs_solver.py` - ZVS analysis
3. `backend/app/services/sim/devices/library.py` - Device CSV loading
4. `backend/app/services/compliance/rules_engine.py` - Compliance evaluation
5. `frontend/src/pages/NewRun.tsx` - Simulation form
6. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main UI

### Debugging Tips:
- Use `print()` statements liberally (easier than debugger)
- Test each feature in isolation before integration
- Use Postman/curl to test API endpoints directly
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- SQLite DB can be inspected with `sqlite3 power_platform.db`

## Commit Message for This Session

```
WIP: Add demo mode authentication and attempt Docker fix

This session focused on getting localhost working but encountered
persistent Docker Desktop stability issues on Mac.

Changes made:
- Added DEMO_MODE config for anonymous access
- Modified get_current_user() to create demo user when no auth token
- Added /api/auth/demo endpoint for getting demo JWT
- Auto-creates demo organization for demo users
- Fixed WeasyPrint import to be optional
- Fixed CORS to include localhost:3001
- Fixed frontend parameter mapping (pout, phi_deg)

Known issues:
- Docker Desktop crashes repeatedly on Mac
- PostgreSQL connection never stable
- Frontend shows ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors
- System never fully tested end-to-end

NEXT SESSION: Switch to SQLite and verify ALL master prompt features
are implemented before worrying about Docker deployment.
```
