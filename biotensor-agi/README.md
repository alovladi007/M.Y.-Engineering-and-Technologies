# BioTensor Labs Medical AGI System

## Overview

A comprehensive medicine-focused AGI built as a **system of systems** for clinicians, researchers, and medical students. This platform provides secure, auditable, and clinically-validated AI assistance across the entire healthcare continuum.

## System Architecture

### 0. Secure Data & Compute Plane (Foundation)
- **Purpose**: PHI/PII-safe compute and storage with full audit trails
- **Components**: Hybrid Kubernetes, encrypted storage, zero-trust networking, compliance engine

### 1. Clinical Data Ingestion & Harmonization
- **Purpose**: Transform heterogeneous clinical data into AI-ready streams
- **Protocols**: HL7 v2/v3, FHIR R4/R5, DICOM, lab interfaces, device streams
- **Normalization**: SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-10, CPT mapping

### 2. Unified Clinical Knowledge Graph (UCG)
- **Purpose**: Living knowledge base fusing patient data with biomedical ontologies
- **Features**: Temporal patient graphs, guideline encoding, causal reasoning

### 3. Foundation Model Stack
- **Modalities**: Text (clinical notes), Vision (medical imaging), Time-series (vitals), Genomics
- **Architecture**: Multimodal transformers with uncertainty quantification

### 4. Clinical Tools & Services
- **Components**: Risk calculators, guideline engines, trial matching, causal inference
- **Safety**: Bias detection, content validation, PHI guards

### 5. Cognition & Orchestration (Agents)
- **Agents**: Diagnostic Copilot, Therapy Planner, Radiology Assistant, ICU Monitor
- **Coordination**: Task planning, tool routing, safety checks, memory management

### 6. Application Layer
- **Interfaces**: Clinician UI, Research Workbench, Education Portal
- **APIs**: FHIR-native, event-driven, SDK support

### 7. Safety, Governance & Evaluation
- **Features**: Policy engine, provenance tracking, calibration, bias monitoring
- **Compliance**: HIPAA, FDA guidelines, clinical validation protocols
